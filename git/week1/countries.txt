Ireland: the first country I lived in outside Argentina.
Denmark: my second and final country (fun fact, my morfar was danish). 
Germany: my third country. I went to the hectic Berlin just to find Copenhagen was my place on earth.  
Italy, Greece and Turkey: I took 1 month holiday with my parents after 3 years away from them. Best decision ever, take care of your parents.
Amsterdam: amazing 2 week experience. Best place to go when your heart is broken. The Van Gogh Museum is a must.
