My favorite food is sushi, 
not because I am a fancy bitch but because I worked in 2 sushi restaurants. 
I discovered is so versatile, healthy and wonderful, so full of flavours and textures.
I also discovered then that all diets that exclude rice are stupid: I ate rice everyday during 6 months and 
didn't gain 1 single kilo.
