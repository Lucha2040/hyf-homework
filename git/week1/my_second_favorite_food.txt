My second favorite food is EMPANADAS. 
They are tipical from Argentina, but I love how is such a portable, delicious food. 
They can be with meat, fish, vegetarian, or even vegan, so you can always cook for all. 
They can be oven baked or deep fried. 
It doesn't matter, they are awesome in any way. 
And you can even make sweet dessert ones!
