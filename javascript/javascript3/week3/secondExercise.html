<body>

    <h1>Waiting for the promise to resolve...</h1>
    
    <p>Create a function that has one parameter: resolveAfter. Calling this function will return a promise that resolves after the resolveAfter seconds has passed. Here is an example: makeUpYourOwnFunctionName(3) will return a promise that resolves after 3 seconds. Use the makeUpYourOwnFunctionName to log out the string I am called asynchronously after 6 seconds.
